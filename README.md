# DKNNAISE
The platform for DKNN+AISE.
## Platform
* Python: 3.7
* PyTorch: 1.5.0
## Functions
1. Training CNNs and robust CNNs
2. Training DkNN
3. Obtain features (CNN representations) of each inputs
4. Calculating adversarial accuracy of CNNs and DkNN
5. More functions will be released
## Howto
1. Train a CNN using cifar_train.ipynb (results include clean accuracy and adversarial accuracy. We already provide a trained model in the path /models/)
2. Run the file main.ipynb.
3. The results will show the clean accuracy, adversarial accuracy, confidence, credibility.
